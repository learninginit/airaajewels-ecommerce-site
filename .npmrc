# Prevents pnpm from failing if the lockfile is not up-to-date with package.json.
# This is useful in CI environments where you might want to allow pnpm to update the lockfile.
# Use with caution, as it can lead to non-reproducible builds if not managed properly.
# For this project, it's used to allow Vercel's build environment to resolve dependencies.
